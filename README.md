Portfolio Reflection: Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
Author: Nurlan Gasimzade

1. Work Completed
For this project, I worked on developing an intelligent pirate agent that uses deep Q-learning to locate a treasure within a maze environment before a human player does. I was provided with the base code for the game environment (TreasureMaze.py) and the memory management system (GameExperience.py). I created the reinforcement learning logic myself—this included designing the neural-network model, implementing the Q-learning algorithm, updating the replay memory, and adjusting exploration and exploitation parameters. The final Jupyter Notebook integrates all components and demonstrates how the pirate agent learns optimal navigation paths through repeated episodes of training.

2. Connecting Learning to Computer Science
Computer scientists design intelligent systems that solve real-world problems through data analysis, algorithms, and automation. This project reflected the essence of that work—combining algorithmic reasoning, data-driven decision-making, and ethical design. By building and refining a reinforcement-learning model, I learned how computer scientists break complex problems into smaller logical steps and then train systems to improve performance over time. Understanding neural networks and Q-learning connected theory to practice, showing how abstract mathematical models can lead to intelligent behavior in a virtual environment.

3. Approach to Problem Solving
I approached this challenge as a computer scientist by experimenting, testing, and iterating. Each training run offered insight into how parameter adjustments—such as learning rate, discount factor, or epsilon decay—affected performance. I used debugging, data visualization, and experimentation to guide improvements, mirroring the iterative development process used in industry AI research and software engineering.

4. Ethical Responsibilities
Working with AI also reinforced my awareness of ethical obligations. As a developer, I am responsible for ensuring that the systems I create are transparent, secure, and fair. Reinforcement learning can introduce unintended behaviors, so ongoing monitoring and ethical evaluation are vital. To the end user and the organization, I owe honesty in data collection, privacy protection, and accountability in how AI decisions are made. These principles ensure that artificial intelligence remains a tool for human benefit rather than harm.
